# ducklib

## Why ducklib?

Ducklib is a library made by team 14343 Escape Velocity meant to be good at scheduling commands.
It's an alternative to Roadrunner Actions, FTCLib, and Dairy (at least Util and Mercurial).

It's made to be ergonomic for most common tasks,
to have a rich scheduling system while being still intuitive to those coming from FTCLib,
to use idiomatic Kotlin patterns,
and to keep your code concise and readable,
allowing you to focus more on what you *want* and now how you do it.
