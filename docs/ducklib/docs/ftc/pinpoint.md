description: ducklib comes with a pinpoint driver modified to use ducklib's geometry component

# goBILDA Pinpoint

It works as you'd expect
(e.g. as the normal driver works, but with ducklib Inches/Radians/Pose2/Vector2 instead of the robotcore navigation).

[Here's a link to the original driver](https://github.com/goBILDA-Official/FtcRobotController-Add-Pinpoint/blob/goBILDA-Odometry-Driver/TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/GoBildaPinpointDriver.java)
